            I'm 30 years old and live in Spokane, WA with my wife and dog. We moved here from North Carolia in 2022 for my wife, Karla, to pursue her JD at Gonzaga University. I completed a BA in Communication in 2017 and an MBA in 2020, both from Queens University of Charlotte. I'm currently searching for my next career.

            You will see in my resume, that most of my previous work experience is from Queens where I worked in the Admissions Office, primarially on the Operations Team where we used a robust Admissions CRM, Slate. Our team was was inegral to enrolling students. I worked to ensure that our Admissions staff could smoothly collect and review applications, find and communicate with studnets in a timely manner. I also collaborated with the marketing team to deliever accurate, timely mass communications, as well created and maintained interactive 'portal' webpages for students to use while their track their appliction status. Lastly, I created and maintained our application funnel data, working with our Vice President to design clear and accurate reports to track our progress.

            At the beginning on 2024 I began a Full Stack Software Engineering Certificate through Gonzaga University, hosted by Springboard. In June, 2024 I lost my job at Queens due to budget reductions. After working through several personal and professional challenges in the past year, I have completed my Certificate and am looking for my next opportunity. As I begin my search, I'm looking for roles to combine the skills I have, and help me continue to build and polish my technial ability. I believe I could be a great fit on a Software Development team, a Sales or Marketing Ops Team, or potentially as a project manager.
